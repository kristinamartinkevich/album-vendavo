# Creating a simple application with React

Via NPM
```bash
$ npm create vite@latest
```
or Yarn
```bash
$ yarn create vite
```

### The Assignment

Your task is to create a web application allowing users to browse albums and photos. Users should have the ability to view, edit, and rearrange albums and photos, as well as add or remove photos. Additionally, users should be able to search for specific albums or photos by title. Each album should display information about its creator. To manage pagination efficiently, implement virtual scrolling with 20 items per page.

The project consists of two separate applications. The first application will handle routing, while the second application will focus on implementing the described functionality. Ensure that the second application's code can be dynamically loaded into the first one without using relative imports.

As an additional task, you may develop a third application enabling users to access the last 20 photos they recently viewed. This functionality should also be dynamically loaded into the first application.

To complete the assignment, use the ReactJS library and fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API. Structure your project as a monorepo and upload it to GitHub. # album-vendavo
